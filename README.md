# Hi, I’m **Dex Campbell**   

**Masters Graduate in Computational Physics – University of Exeter**  
I’m passionate about **computational simulations, creative coding, and problem-solving through algorithms**.  
I enjoy exploring the intersection of physics, data, and creative software development.

## What I Do

- **Computational Physics & Simulations** – building models such as Ising systems and convection dynamics  
- **Creative Coding & Game Logic** – writing interactive programs and visualizations  
- **Algorithmic Thinking** – tackling complex problems with efficient, structured code
